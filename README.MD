## API and Test / Mocha Chai

1ª Init Project in Node.js

2º Express:
    Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application
    framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js,
    released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.
    It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
    It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

3º CORS: 
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that 
    allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than 
    its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also 
    relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the 
    server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server 
    will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers 
    that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual 
    request.

4º  Body-Parser: 
    Express body-parser is an npm module used to process data sent 
    in an HTTP request body. It provides four express middleware for parsing JSON,
    Text, URL-encoded, and raw data sets over an HTTP request body. Before the
    target controller receives an incoming request, these middleware routines 
    handle it.

5º  DOTENV: 
    Dotenv is a zero-dependency library or module that exists in most programming
    languages, which loads environment variables from a . env file for easier 
    management.

6º  Mongoose: 
    Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
    It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is 
    used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those 
    objects in MongoDB.

7º  Nodemon: 
    nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by 
    automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the 
    directory are detected. nodemon does not require any additional changes to 
    your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for 
    node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when 
    executing your script.
